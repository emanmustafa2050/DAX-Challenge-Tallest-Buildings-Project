DAX Challenge: Analyzing the World's Tallest Buildings
Problem:
Given a dataset of the world's tallest buildings, calculate the average floor height for each building, considering potential data errors (e.g., buildings with zero floors).

Solution:
This repository contains a Power BI file demonstrating a DAX solution to this challenge.

Key Steps:

Data Import: Import the provided Excel file into data model.

DAX Calculation: Create a calculated column in the data model to calculate the average floor height using the following DAX formula:

This formula ensures that buildings with zero floors are assigned a blank value.

Data Visualization: Create a table or chart to visualize the results, sorting the buildings by their average floor height.
